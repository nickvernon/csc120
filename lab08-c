; Recall that a parametric data definition is one that 
; contains a type variable, allowing it to abstract from
; referring to a particular collection (or type) of data,
; similarly to the way a function abstracts from a
; particular data value.
; 
; To use a parametric data definition, we supply a 
; concrete type of data in place of the type variables. This
; is known as "instantiantion", and is similar, again, to
; the way we supply values to a function by applying it.
; 
; For example, the abstracted `(Listof X)` data definition 
; can be instantiated as follows:
;  
;  - (Listof Number)  -- representing a list of numbers
;  - (Listof Image)   -- representing a list of images
;  - etc.
; 
; 
; 
; Consider the following parametric data definition:
; 



; A (Maybe X) is one of:
; – false
; – X


;                                                           
; TASK 1.
; 
; Describe in plain English what each of the following 
; instantiations of the Maybe data type represents:
; 
; 
;  - (Maybe String)            -- is a string or false
;  - (Maybe (Listof String))   -- is a list of strings or false
;  - (Listof (Maybe String))   -- is a list of strings or false
; 
; 





;                                                           
; TASK 2.
; 
; Fill in a purpose statement for the following function and
; then complete its definition.
; 



;; tail : String (Listof String) -> (Maybe (List-of String))
;; produce a list of strings beginning at given string

(check-expect (tail "a" empty) false)
(check-expect (tail "a" (list "a" "b" "c")) (list "a" "b" "c"))
(check-expect (tail "d" (list "b" "a" "d" "f")) (list "d" "f"))
(check-expect (tail "a" (list "b" "c" "d")) false)

(define (tail s los)
  (cond
    [(empty? los) false]
    [(cons? los) (if (string=? s (first los))
                    (cons s (rest los))
                    (tail s (rest los)))]))
