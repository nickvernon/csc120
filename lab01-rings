;; Lab 1 - Exercises with rings

(require 2htdp/image)

;                                                                     
; TASKS:
; 
; 1. Uncomment the lines below and then "Run" this file to see the 
;    image produced. 
; 
; 2. Look up the 'overlay' operator using the Help Desk (DrRacket's, 
;    not Berry's). Under the "Help" menu, select "Help Desk". This
;    should open a web browser with a text field at the top to use
;    for searching. Search for "overlay". Choose the result that is
;    provided from "2htdp/image".
;    
;    You can also search function/operator names directly by 
;    right-clicking on the name and choose the "Search in Help
;    Desk for ..." option.
;    
; 3. Try making a few more rings of different sizes and thicknesses.
;    What happens if you try to use a negative number instead of
;    positive numbers? (Try it and see.)
;    
; 4. The Stepper is a DrRacket tool that shows every step a program 
;    takes (that is, the sequence of simplifications that takes place).
;    Activate the Stepper with the button labeled "Step" with a picture
;    of a foot, to the left of the Run button. Trying pressing the 
;    "Step" button now. This should bring up a separate window which 
;    lets you see how DrRacket is evaluating your program. Step through
;    the expression. Try to predict what the next step will be 
;    each time.
;    
; 5. Errors: Expect to make many syntax errors (spelling, punctuation) 
;    in your programs as you are learning. To see what happens if 
;    DrRacket can't understand your program, introduce various syntax 
;    errors into your program (remove a paren, put in too many parens, 
;    misspell a word, leave out one of the arguments to circle, etc) 
;    and study the error messages when you click the "Run" button.
;    


(overlay
  (circle 5 "solid" "white")
  (circle 10 "solid" "red"))

(overlay
 (circle 20 "solid" "white")
 (circle 40 "solid" "blue"))
 

;                                                                     
; IF YOU'RE WORKING WITH A PARTNER, SWITCH ROLES NOW!

;                                                                     
; TASK:
; 
; Create an expression(s) that produces the following image: 
; 
; .
; 
; The inner radius of the larger ring is 10 and its 
; outer radius is 20. Hint: Use the 'above' operator.
; 
; Define names for intermediate pieces of the picture if possible.
; Do you end up with repeated code? (That's good - by next week,
; we will have learned a way to eliminate this sort of 
; redundancy in code.)
