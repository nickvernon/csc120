;                                                                     
;  Notice the line above is preceded by a semi-colon (;).
;  This is an example of a comment - a line in your program that
;  is completely ignored by DrRacket when you "Run" your file. 
;  
;  There are several ways to insert a comment in a BSL program.
;  The simplest is to use a semi-colon to comment out
;  everything ; on the rest of that particular line
;  
;  Another way is to insert a "comment box" (which is what all the
;  text that you are reading right now is in) using the
;  Insert -> Insert Comment Box menu option.
;  
;  In a file with exercises like this, we will provide TASKs for
;  you to complete as comments. You should fill in your answers below
;  the TASK box as directed. If you are ever unsure about anything, 
;  please raise your hand for help.
;  
;  Before you leave class, please make sure I have looked over your
;  work.

;                                                                     
; TASK:
; 
; Add your own name(s) as a comment at the very top of this file.
; You should always make sure you do this with any file that you 
; work on.

;                                                                     
; The lectures so far have shown how to form various kinds of 
; expressions in BSL.
; 
; BSL's ("Beginning Student Language") method of writing expressions 
; (where the operator always comes first, before the operands) is 
; called "prefix notation," as opposed to the normal "infix notation" 
; of mathematics. 
; 




;                                                                     
; TASK:
; 
; Write two expressions that multiply the 
; numbers 3, 5 and 7. 
; 
; The first should take advantage of the fact that * can 
; accept more than 2 arguments. 
; 
; The second should build up the result by first multiplying 
; 3 times 5 and then multiply the result of that by 7. 
; 
; (7m)


(* 3 5 7)
(* (* 3 5) 7)




;                                                                     
; TASK:
; 
; Write the BSL expression that represents the arithmetic expression:
; 
; (6 + 3) * (9 - 7)
; 
; which equals 18.  Do not just write 18! Instead, write a 
; BSL expression that clearly has the same structure as the given
; expression.
; 
; (5m)


(*(+ 6 3)(- 9 7))



;                                                                     
; TASK:
; 
; Use the DrRacket square, beside and above functions to create an 
; image like this one:
; 
; .
; 
; If you prefer to be more creative feel free to do so. You can use 
; other DrRacket image functions to make a more interesting or more 
; attractive image.
; 
; Remember to (require 2htdp/image) at the top of this file in
; order to be able to use the image operators.

; TASK:
; 
; Define two constant strings named FIRST and LAST with your
; first and last name.
; 
; Then, write an expression that combines the two names together,
; with a period in between them, to form your Berry email user name.

; A Boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to a 
; true or false value.
; 
; 
; TASK:
; 
; Uncomment the two lines below this box. Based on the two constant
; definitions provided, write three Boolean expressions to determine 
; whether: 
; 
; 1) IMAGE1 is taller than IMAGE2
; 2) IMAGE1 is narrower than IMAGE2
; 3) IMAGE1 has both the same width AND height as IMAGE2
; 
; Hint: The following primitive functions might be useful:
;     - image-width
;     - image-height
;     - and

(and (= (image-width IMAGE1)(image-width IMAGE2))
        (= (image-height IMAGE1)(image-height IMAGE2)))

; TASK: 
; 
; Convert the following algebraic expressions into BSL
; prefix notation. Follow the standard order of operations for 
; arithmetic that you learned way back when.
; 
; [Hint: No two of these expressions has quite the same translation! 
;        For each expression, the relative order of the numbers 
;        should remain the same, but the position of the operators may 
;        change, and you will need more parentheses.]
; 
; Do NOT write your answers as comments - when you click the "Run"
; button on the top-right of this window, you want DrRacket to 
; evaluate the expressions you've typed, so that you can check your
; answers.
